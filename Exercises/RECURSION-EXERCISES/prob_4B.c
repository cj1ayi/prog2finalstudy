/*
   Write a RECURSIVE implementation of the function Multipliers()
   that will display digits from the LEFT to the RIGHT 
   and their associated position (1s, 10s, 100s, etc..) in the 
   power of 10 number representation, i.e., ones,tens, hundreds, thousands...   

   Examples:  

      Multipliers(568, 1) will print the following as a result:
        5  100s
        6  10s
        8  1s

     
      Multipliers(90653, 1) will produce the following as a result:
        9  10000s
        0  1000s 
        6  100s  
        5  10s
        3  1s

       THINK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING FIRST!
       
       1. What is the condition for the base case?  
          What are the processing steps needed for the base case?
       
       2. What is the condition for the recursive case? 
          What are the processing steps needed for the recursive case?
